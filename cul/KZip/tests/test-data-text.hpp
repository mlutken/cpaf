    "MISSION CONTROL I wouldn't worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your "
    "tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether "
    "or not it actually fails. If the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional "
    "error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. It has almost always revolved around a "
    "single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's "
    "performance in other areas. No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. It may be over-programming, but it could "
    "also be any number of reasons. In any event, it is somewhat analogous to human neurotic behavior. Does this answer your query?  "
