Check-out Chipmunk physics engine:

  svn checkout http://chipmunk-physics.googlecode.com/svn/tags/Chipmunk-5.2.0 chipmunk

(5.2.0 is used instead of trunk, because this example is known to work with
that version and not necessarily any future versions).

To improve the performance on embedded platform, force the use of 'float' instead of 'double':

  patch chipmunk/include/chipmunk/chipmunk_types.h force-float.patch
