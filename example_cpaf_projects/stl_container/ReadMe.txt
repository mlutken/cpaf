
It seems very hard indeed to find anything on the net or in C++ STL books
about how to implement a fully compliant STL container with class iterators, 
how to use the allocator etc.
So now I've made this easy to understand example, which should more or less 
show it all.


See the "stl_boost/my_container.hpp" for the implementation.
Test code is located in "stl_boost/_test/_my_container.cpp", which contains
4 functions that can be run from any console main() function.
